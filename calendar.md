# Calendar

This is the calendar for Dr. Love's Section 1 of 431 in Fall 2018. All class meetings are scheduled for 1:00 PM to 2:15 PM in room E321-323 on the third floor of the Robbins building at the School of Medicine. 

Books we are reading: 

- **Silver** - this is *The Signal and the Noise* by Nate Silver, which you need to [purchase for this course](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/index.html#what-do-i-need-to-buy). Some chapters are going to feel more relevant to you than others, and that's fine.
- **Leek** - this is *The Elements of Data Analytic Style* by Jeff Leek, which you must also [purchase](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/index.html#what-do-i-need-to-buy). The book is short, and I encourage you to simply read it, as soon as possible (it won't take more than a couple of hours), then refer to it later in the term as specific issues arise.
- **R4DS** - this is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This semester, we'll focus on the Explore (Section I) and Communicate (Section V) materials, mostly, with some additional pieces from the other parts of the book.
