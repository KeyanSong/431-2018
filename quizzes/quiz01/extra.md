# An Extra Example for Part A: Sleep and Mammals

This example reviews some of the key work we did in Part A of the course. It uses the `msleep` data set, which is part of the `ggplot2` package. Use the help file for that data set or visit http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/msleep.html to assist in understanding the data.

## The Questions

1. Identify the number of rows and number of variables in the `msleep` data set.
2. Specify the variable with the largest number of missing values. How many values are missing?
3. Identify the mammal who remains `awake` the longest, per day. What is the Z score for this mammal?
4. Display your R code to create a data set (called `sleep2`) from `msleep` which contains the variables `name`, `order`, `vore`, `sleep_cycle` and `sleep_rem` for those animals who have no missing values in any of those four variables, then convert the `vore` information into a factor. 
5. According to the `order` variable, how many Primates (see the `order` variable) exist in your `sleep2` data set?
6. Draw a plot to compare the `sleep_rem` levels by `vore` group using your `sleep2` data. What do you conclude?
7. Produce R code using the `%>%` pipe to produce a table which answers these two questions for the `sleep2` data: [a] Which `vore` group has the largest mean `sleep_rem` level? [b] Which `vore` group has the largest mean `sleep_cycle`? 
8. Now, return to the original `msleep` data for questions 8-10. Build a scatterplot of `brainwt` and `bodywt`, first using the raw data and then using a logarithmic scale for each variable. 
9. Fit a linear model to the scatterplot you drew in part 8 for which a linear model seems more appropriate, and specify and describe (in a sentence of two) both the fitted least squares equation *and* the Pearson correlation coefficient.
10. Identify the mammal in your model (in part 9) with the largest (in absolute value) regression residual.
