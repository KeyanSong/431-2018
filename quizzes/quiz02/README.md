# 431 Quiz 2 for 2018

This will be the main page for materials related to Quiz 2.

## General Instructions

The deadline for completing this quiz is 5 PM on Tuesday 2018-12-11, and this is a firm deadline. Do not miss the deadline.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz and then return to it later, you can do this by [1] scrolling down to the final question which asks you to type in your full name, affirming that you have done the work for the quiz alone, and then [2] submitting the quiz. You will then receive a link at your CWRU email which will allow you to return to the quiz without losing your progress.

There are 40 questions, labeled Q01 through Q40. The maximum score available is 110 points.

- Each question is worth between 2 and 6 points. Partial credit is available on some questions.
- Note that Q01 is probably the question which will take the longest amount of time for you to answer, so donâ€™t worry that the other 39 questions are as lengthy as that one.
- The order of the questions is arbitrary. Some are meant to be easy, some are not.
- You should attempt to answer every question. There is no advantage to failing to give a response, as an incorrect response is always at least as valuable as a missing one.
- Please select or type in your best response (or responses, as indicated) for each question.

## Data Sets

Data sets are available for several of the questions. Those data sets will be posted at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz02 at the time the quiz is made available. 

- Our usual `Love-boost.R` script will also be used in developing the answer sketch, and you should assume you will use it in the Quiz, as well.

## Assumptions We Want You To Make

For any question where we do not specify something different, you should assume the following:

- that you are looking to do two-sided statistical inference with a 95% confidence level.
- that you should round all numerical responses to two decimal places.
- that two-by-two tables should be built without Bayesian adjustments

Please use `set.seed(2018)` whenever you need to do work that requires random sampling.

## Packages We Used

The packages we loaded in R to complete the Answer Sketch for this Quiz were:

- `Hmisc`, `fivethirtyeight`, `car`, `broom`, `magrittr`, and the `tidyverse`.
- We also made use of functions from `knitr`, `mosaic` and `gridExtra` and those were installed, but not loaded with `library()`.
- You may also need to use a function from the `vcd` package, which should also be installed on your machine.
- As mentioned above, we also sourced in the `Love-boost.R` script.

You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants at `431-help at case dot edu`. Please submit any questions you have about the Quiz to `431-help` through email. 

Good Luck!
