# 431 Fall 2018 Class 26: 2018-12-06

## Today's Materials

- The slides for Class 26 are available [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class26/431_class-26-slides_2018.pdf) and [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class26/431_class-26-slides_2018.Rmd).
- Class 26 audio files will be posted after class.

## Remaining Deliverables

- Quiz 2 will be released to you by 5 PM on 2018-12-06, and will be due on 2018-12-11 at 5 PM. 
  - Quiz links will be posted at the [Quiz 2 home page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz02). The instructions are available there now. Let us know at `431-help` if you have any questions.
- The [Project Presentation (Task H) Schedule](http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-schedule) specifies your time and date (12-10, 12-11 or 12-13).
  - If you are unsure whether to use your Markdown file or build a separate Powerpoint for your presentation, here's my advice:
      - For most people, I recommend you use Markdown/HTML for both Studies.
      - If you're great at Powerpoint and really love using it, then use Markdown/HTML for Study 1 and Powerpoint for Study 2.
- [Project Task G (the Portfolio)](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskG.html) is due Thursday 2018-12-13 at noon, regardless of when you give your presentation. Submit it via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
  - If you need to resubmit your data (because of changes you've made), you can do so now through Project Task F on Canvas (which has been re-opened for this purpose) or you can just submit it along with your portfolio as part of Task G.
- The [Homework Grading Appeals form](https://goo.gl/forms/G4ZZ1Fge1ZkQVKzy2) is also due Thursday 2018-12-13 at noon, if you want to make an appeal. See the last section of the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/) for more details.
- After you give your presentation, we hope you will fill out a [Course Evaluation](https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/) from CWRU by their 2018-12-19 deadline.

## Homework 8 Grades/Rubric/Sketch

- Homework 8 grades, as well as course homework grades, are posted to http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades.
- The Answer Sketch for Homework 8 is available [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework8/431-2018-hw8sketch.pdf) and [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework8/431-2018-hw8sketch.Rmd).
- The Homework 8 grading rubric is [also available now in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework8/431-2018-hw8rubric.pdf).

## After Today's Class Audio is Posted, Where Do I Go for Updates?

I'll be posting things at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/slides/postclass. 

- All that is there now is a description of how your grade in the course will be calculated.

## Office Hours and `431-help`

- TA office hours continue through Friday 2018-12-07. If you need to meet with a TA outside of office hours, arrange that through `431-help`. They are doing this on a volunteer basis, so no promises of availability are possible. If you need help, use `431-help`.
- `431-help` will be open until I finish with projects at on Thursday 2017-12-13. 

## Minute Paper After Class 25

My feedback is available at http://bit.ly/431-2018-minute25-response.

## Projects: What am I thinking about in reviewing your work?

- Introducing the material in such a way as to allow me to understand the problem sufficiently.
- Presenting a statistically sound plan of action.
- Motivating your choices about study design and analysis well.
- Developing reasonable solutions to analytic problems.
- Focusing on important issues in the presentation (written or orally).
- Making clear recommendations and supporting them with analytic results.
- Effectively and appropriately responding to questions.
- Avoiding making clearly incorrect statements about data, statistical methods, or the subject matter.

## Visualization of the Day

Here is a [Master List of 50 ggplot2 Visualizations with full R code](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html) by Selva Prabhakaran.

## Two Last Things

1. Here is Jeff Leek's [Non-comprehensive list of awesome things other people did in 2017](https://simplystatistics.org/2017/12/20/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-in-2017/)
  - The [Exploring Histograms](http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/) essay by Aran Lunzer and Amelia McNamara, for example, is something to see.

2. [The Ten Fallacies of Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ten-fallacies-of-data-science-9b2af78a1862) is great. I particularly like Number 7 and Number 1.
