## Today's Materials

- The slides for Class 26 are available [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class26/431_class-26-slides_2018.pdf) and [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class26/431_class-26-slides_2018.Rmd).
- Class 26 audio files will be posted after class.

## Remaining Deliverables

- Quiz 2 will be released to you by 5 PM on 2018-12-06, and will be due on 2018-12-11 at 5 PM. 
  - Quiz links will be posted at the [Quiz 2 home page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/quizzes/quiz02). The instructions are available there now. Let us know at `431-help` if you have any questions.
- The [Project Presentation (Task H) Schedule](http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-schedule) specifies your time and date (12-10, 12-11 or 12-13).
  - If you are unsure whether to use your Markdown file or build a separate Powerpoint for your presentation, here's my advice:
      - For most people, I recommend you use Markdown/HTML for both Studies.
      - If you're great at Powerpoint and really love using it, then use Markdown/HTML for Study 1 and Powerpoint for Study 2.
- [Project Task G (the Portfolio)](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskG.html) is due Thursday 2018-12-13 at noon, regardless of when you give your presentation. Submit it via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
  - If you need to resubmit your data (because of changes you've made), you can do so now through Project Task F on Canvas (which has been re-opened for this purpose) or you can just submit it along with your portfolio as part of Task G.
- The [Homework Grading Appeals form](https://goo.gl/forms/G4ZZ1Fge1ZkQVKzy2) is also due Thursday 2018-12-13 at noon, if you want to make an appeal. See the last section of the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/) for more details.
- After you give your presentation, we hope you will fill out a [Course Evaluation](https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/) from CWRU by their 2018-12-19 deadline.
