## Questions on Projects

**When should I transform/impute/drop missing outcomes/check residual plots/look at AIC and BIC in my project?** Whenever works best for you. The demonstration projects are not edicts to be followed slavishly. They are a demonstration of one potentially useful way to get the job done. If it makes more sense to you to do B then A, instead of A then B, go ahead.

**Which of my six analyses should I choose to present to you for Study 1?** Whichever one provides the most interesting result, in your opinion. Remember that I will pick one of the other six, not completely at random, so you need to be ready to present any of them.

**Which part of Study 2 will I have to present?** Potentially, everything, Practically, we'll have more fun if we focus less on data cleaning and management than on interpreting and understanding what your models have to say about the data. So be sure you're as clear as possible with regard to everything you've done to get the data into good shape.

## gendercodeR is [now available](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gendercoder)

> Researchers who collect self-reported demographic data from respondents occasionally collect gender using a free-text response option. This has the advantage of respecting the gender diversity of respondents without prompting users and potentially including misleading responses. However, this presents a challenge to researchers in that some inconsistencies in typography and spelling create a larger set of responses than would be required to fully capture the demographic characteristics of the sample.
> This package uses dictionaries of common misspellings to recode these freetext responses into a consistent set of responses.

## Visualization of the Day

For those of you who cannot get enough of election maps, try this one from https://xkcd.com/1939/

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/2016_election_map.png)

Alan Cole discusses [several nice features of this map in this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/AlanMCole/status/950415038506037254). His summary comment there is...

> So what I like about this map is that gives an accurate sense of the popular vote, and an accurate sense of how both coalitions are actually distributed throughout the country. It is the most elegant and informative election map I have seen.

Later, he clarifies this to say:

> There are two things we're interested in: (a) the underlying distribution of voters around the country, and (b) the way that distribution interacted with the election rules to produce a result. This map is the best at (a), not (b).
