## The Project Study 1 Template

Dr. Love emailed you a template for Project Study 1 on 2018-11-17. It is also available as an [R Markdown file here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/study1template/431-project-study1_template.Rmd). 

- The template has some nice features, and it should import the data properly, freeing you to start pruning the big data set down to what you actually need. 
- The template assumes you have an R project directory for project study 1 containing this R Markdown file, the five data sets, and the Love-boost.R script, [all of which are posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/study1template).
- If you want to see what the HTML file looks like that the template creates, it is [posted at this RPubs site](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/Project-study1-template-431-2018).
