## Minute Paper after Class 17

Everyone completed it. Thanks! The responses are at http://bit.ly/431-2018-minute17-response.

### Notes on the Project

1. Whether your results are significant or not has nothing to do with your grade on the project. That's true for Study 1 and for Study 2. 
2. In each Study, showing that you can make smart decisions about which way to go (and update your plans accordingly) in light of the data once you have it is a key part of your grade on the project.
3. My best advice on timing:
    - Right now, get a clean version of your Project Study 2 pulled together and make the codebook for all of your predictors and outcome.
    - After that, when you get the data for Project Study 1 (from the Survey) from me next week, move on to working on Project Study 1 exclusively, through about November 15 or so. You should be able to get pretty far along on most (if not all) of the six required Study 1 analyses by then.
    - When November 15 comes, and the Project Study 2 demo is posted, get rolling again on Project Study 2.
    - By the end of Thanksgiving week, try to have Project Study 1 done. Then spend the time until your presentation on Study 2.

### Helping Out

One student asked "Can others in the class provide a hint of what resource they have found most helpful to them for this class (ex: R cheat sheets, the class notes, etc)?"

- I'll try to remember to ask about this in the Class 19 minute paper, but if you have any thoughts that you would like to share, please send them to **431-help**, and we'll compile them.

## Visualizations of the Day

- We'll spend a few minutes at the [FiveThirtyEight forecasts](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate) again, delving deeper into the Congressional model (House and Senate).
- The Upshot (NY Times) is polling **live**, in real time at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/elections-polls.html
    - The key article explaining this is by Nate Cohn "[Live From the Battleground Districts: Polls of the Key Races for House Control](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/upshot/midterms-2018-polls-live.html)" posted 2018-09-06.

## Additional Courses at DataCamp to Consider

- G Elliott Morris on "[Analyzing Election and Polling Data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r)" which seems aimed at people with journalism backgrounds but may be of interest.
- Kyle Walker on "[Analyzing US Census Data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-us-census-data-in-r)" which seems like something I need to take, in preparation for some work we'll be doing in 432.
- Dmitriy Gorenshteyn on "[Machine Learning in the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-in-the-tidyverse)" which also seems like a piece that will be of more help in 432.

## One (Well, Four) Last Thing(s)

- "[Biostatistics vs. Lab Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbODigCZqL8)"
- "[Power of the test, p-values, publication bias and statistical evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMYxd6QeAss)"
- "[Publish or Perish (the p value)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax0tDcFkPic)"
- "[What's the p value?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax0tDcFkPic)"
