# How Your Grade in 431 Is Determined

## The Four Elements

1. I begin by establishing your **course participation grade**, which falls in the range of 70 - 100. This is based on four things: 
    - your actual in-class and out-of-class participation, as noted by Dr. Love
    - your contributions to 431-help, asking questions, etc.
    - your involvement with the teaching assistants, through attending office hours, asking questions, etc.
    - your feedback through the Minute Papers
    - there's also a bonus for special contributions (things like providing the audio recordings for the class)
  
2. Your **course homework grade** is posted to http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades. It is the minimum of:
    - The sum of your grade on the 8 assignments, divided by 8, and
    - 100

There were four students who requested reviews of their homework grades. I have responded to them via email.

3. Your grade on the quizzes consists of two elements:
    - A = Your Quiz 1 grade (which was on a scale of 0-100 points)
    - B = Your Quiz 2 grade (out of 109 points, but we pretend it is out of 100) 
    - Your **course quiz grade** will be the larger of:
        - 0.40 times A + 0.60 times B, or
        - 0.33 times A + 0.67 times B
        - as long as that score is below 100. If it is above 100, your grade on the quizzes will be 100.
    - You will know your score on Quiz 2 before the end of the day on 2018-12-14.

4. Your **course project grade** is also on a scale of 0-100 points, comprised of:
    - Timely completion of project tasks A, C, D and F: combined 30 points (everyone scored 29 or 30)
    - Task G (your portfolio): 35 points (I expect most students to score 25-30 points on this element)
    - Task H (your presentation): 35 points (I expect most students to score 25-30 points on this element)
    
## Putting It Together    

Your **course score** (on a scale from 0-100) is then determined by adding:
    - 15% of your course participation grade
    - 25% of your course homework grade
    - 30% of your course quiz grade
    - 30% of your course project grade
    
### Final Grade Assignment

- The cutoff was 86.5% for an A. Students with a course score of 86.5 or higher received an A.
- Students with course scores between 70 and 84 received a B.
- No one wound up with a course score between 84 and 86.5, nor did anyone wind up with a score below 70.

## When Will Grades Be Available?

I expect to post course grades to SIS on 2018-12-14, in the afternoon. You should anticipate that the grade will be available to you on SIS sometime on 2018-12-17, perhaps earlier, but I have no control over that.

- I do not post individual elements of project or presentation grades, nor will I send them out via email. I am at CWRU on Monday 2018-12-17 between 1 PM and 3 PM and again on Thursday 2018-12-20 from 11 AM to Noon. If you wish to speak with me in those windows in person or by phone, please request an appointment via email. 
- If you have further questions, I will be available to review emails through 2018-12-21, at which point I will close the books on 431.
