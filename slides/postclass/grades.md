# How Your Grade in 431 Is Determined

## The Four Elements

1. I begin by establishing your **course participation grade**, which falls in the range of 70 - 100. This is based on four things: 
    - your actual in-class and out-of-class participation, as noted by Dr. Love
    - your contributions to 431-help, asking questions, etc.
    - your involvement with the teaching assistants, through attending office hours, asking questions, etc.
    - your feedback through the Minute Papers
    - there's also a bonus for special contributions (things like providing the audio recordings for the class)
  
2. Your **course homework grade** is posted to http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades. It is the minimum of:
    - The sum of your grade on the 8 assignments, divided by 8, and
    - 100
    - and see below about regrade requests.

3. Your grade on the quizzes consists of two elements:
    - A = Your Quiz 1 grade (which was on a scale of 0-100 points)
    - B = Your Quiz 2 grade (out of 110 points, but we pretend it is out of 100) 
    - Your **course quiz grade** will be the larger of:
        - 0.40 times A + 0.60 times B, or
        - 0.33 times A + 0.67 times B
        - as long as that score is below 100. If it is above 100, your grade on the quizzes will be 100.
    - You will know your score on Quiz 2 before the end of the day on 2018-12-14.

4. Your **course project grade** is also on a scale of 0-100 points, comprised of:
    - Timely completion of project tasks A, C, D and F: combined 30 points (everyone scored 29 or 30)
    - Task G (your portfolio): 35 points (I expect most students to score 25-30 points on this element)
    - Task H (your presentation): 35 points (I expect most students to score 25-30 points on this element)
    
## Putting It Together    

Your **course score** (on a scale from 0-100) is then determined by adding:
    - 15% of your course participation grade
    - 25% of your course homework grade
    - 30% of your course quiz grade
    - 30% of your course project grade
    
I have not yet decided what the cutoff for an A/B will be, but will be no lower than 85.0 and no higher than 88.0, and I will not make that determination until after all course scores are available to me, on 2018-12-13. 

- A **course score** of 70.0 - 84.9 will definitely receive a grade of B in the course. 
- A **course score** of 88.0 - 100.0 will definitely receive a grade of A in the course. 
- **Course scores** of 85.0 - 87.9 will be the range where I review all materials again carefully, to make a final determination. 

## Special Circumstances

**Homework Regrade Requests** Students who have a **course score** of 88 or higher (without reviewing the homework regrade requests) will not have their homework reviewed. All others will be reviewed, and homework scores changed appropriately, before I make final determinations of course grades.

- Students with a **course score** below 70 are rare, but it has happened. If it does this year, I'll review the situation after the projects are complete and make a determination about what to do at that time. The main options are C and Incomplete, practically.

## When Will Grades Be Available?

I expect to post course grades to SIS on 2018-12-14, in the afternoon. You should anticipate that the grade will be available to you on SIS sometime on 2018-12-17.

- I do not post individual elements of project or presentation grades, nor will I send them out via email. 
- If you have further questions, Dr. Love will be available to review emails through 2018-12-21, at which point he will close the books on 431.
