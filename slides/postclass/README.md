# Material Posted By Dr. Love After the Final Class of 431

## Quiz 2 grades and answers are now available.

- I have graded Quiz 2. The answer sketch (which includes information on grading for each item) is available now at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/quizzes/quiz02/431-2018-quiz2sketch.pdf. 
  - At the end of that document, I summarize the grades, as well as at the end of the sketch for each item, where I tell you how the class did. 
  - Essentially, the quiz was out of 110 points, but I'm just going to pretend it was really out of 100 points, so if you get 90/110, I'll treat that as if it were 90/100.
  - Your individual Quiz 2 grade for each item and the Quiz as a whole is now posted as a tab in [the homework grading roster](http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades). There is also a tab with your combined Quiz grade across the two quizzes.

**Note**: As of 8 AM 2018-12-12, I fixed an error in one question (#15), which adjusted some people from a grade of 3/4 to 4/4 and one person from 4/4 down to 3/4, and I also addressed typos (that did not affect grading) on page 63 of the sketch, and in question 10, which was worth 2 points (and graded as such) even though the sketch originally said 3. The grades are fixed in the online roster, and the sketch has been reposted. Thank you to the eagle-eyed student who caught these errors.

## Interested in participating in a 5-minute survey from R Studio?

**RStudio asks**: Do you wonder how and why people learn R? If you've learned or are planning to learn R, fill out our 5 minute survey, and we'll present the findings at `rstudio::conf 2019` in Austin, TX. Full disclosure of how the data will be used is on the first page of the survey, which you'll find at https://t.co/MKehzVAGtw

## When Will Information Be Posted About ...

### 432?

Substantial information will be available no later than 2019-01-11. I will send out an email to everyone registered for 432 (or who has requested my permission to enroll in that course) later in December.

- You will need to purchase at least one book for that course, and it is Jeff Leek's [How to Be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist). The suggested price is $10.
- Another text we will use in 432 is Grolemund and Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which, of course, you've already seen in 431.
- There may be another book to buy. You will learn that no later than 2019-01-11.
- Dr. Love will be away January 14-18, so the first class meeting will be **Tuesday 2019-01-21** starting at 1 PM.

### 500?

Substantial information will be available no later than 2019-01-11. I will send out an email to everyone registered for 500 (or who has requested my permission to enroll in that course) later in December.

- For those of you taking the course while you're taking 432, you'll need to get up to speed on logistic regression quickly. I built a [primer on logistic regression modeling in R], based on some material from old 432 notes.
- You will need to purchase at least one book for that course, and it is Paul Rosenbaum's **Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference**. It is available, for instance, at Amazon.com in both Kindle and Hardcover editions, the more expensive of which is $25 at this writing. 
- Dr. Love will be away January 14-18, so the first class meeting will be **Thursday 2018-01-23** starting at 8:30 AM.
