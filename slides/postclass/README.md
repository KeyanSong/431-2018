## Grading and How I Do It

If you want to know everything Dr. Love can think of related to course grading and grades, [read this document](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/postclass/grades.md).

## When Will Information Be Posted About 432?

Substantial information will be available no later than 2019-01-11. I will send out an email to everyone registered for 432 (or who has requested my permission to enroll in that course) later in December.

- You will need to purchase at least one book for that course, and it is Jeff Leek's [How to Be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist). The suggested price is $10.
- Another text we will use in 432 is Grolemund and Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which, of course, you've already seen in 431.
- There may be another book to buy. You will learn that no later than 2019-01-11.
- Dr. Love will be away January 14-18, so the first class meeting will be **Tuesday 2019-01-21** starting at 1 PM.
  - I intend to start addressing emailed questions about 432 will be addressed starting around 2019-01-07.

## When Will Information Be Posted About 500?

Substantial information will be available no later than 2019-01-11. I will send out an email to everyone registered for 500 (or who has requested my permission to enroll in that course) later in December.

- For those of you taking the course while you're taking 432, you'll need to get up to speed on logistic regression quickly. I built a [primer on logistic regression modeling in R], based on some material from old 432 notes.
- You will need to purchase at least one book for that course, and it is Paul Rosenbaum's **Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference**. It is available, for instance, at Amazon.com in both Kindle and Hardcover editions, the more expensive of which is $25 at this writing. 
- Dr. Love will be away January 14-18, so the first class meeting will be **Thursday 2018-01-23** starting at 8:30 AM.
  - I intend to start addressing emailed questions about 500 around 2019-01-07.
