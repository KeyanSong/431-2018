### Minute Paper Links

In the Minute Paper responses, I make reference to several links. They are:

- Rachael Dottle, Ella Koeze and Julia Wolfe at FiveThirtyEight on "[The 2018 Midterms, in 4 Charts](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2018-midterms-in-4-charts/)" from 2018-11-13.
- Andrew Gelman at Slate on "[Why the 2018 Midterms May Have Been Bluer Than You Think](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/midterms-blue-wave-statistics-data-analysis.html) from 2018-11-12.
- I'll also add FiveThirtyEight's politics chat from 2018-11-14 entitled "[Yes, It Was a Blue Wave](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-it-was-a-blue-wave/)".
- The R Studio Conference, or [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) is January 15-18, 2019 in Austin, Texas.

## Project Updates

### Time Management for the Project

It's critical. You need to get both the little details and the big details right in this setting. This will be my final impression of you from 431, so maximize your chance to put forward your best effort.

- Change the name of the project and author to match what **you** are doing. 
- Don't use my words (other than the headings) from the demonstration project to present your work. 
- Don't repeat my instructions or suggestions about how to do things. 
- Make careful decisions while coding and writing in R Markdown, and then review the HTML results to be sure they look clear and attractive. 
- The most useful thing you can do is finish the project well in advance of the deadline, for two reasons.
    1. You have a Quiz to take in December, and doing the Quiz may suggest things that would improve your project, and vice versa.
    2. You will thus have a chance to look at the HTML with fresh eyes before you submit your final work, and this can be **very** helpful.
- After today's class, you should absolutely be able to complete Study 1, and to do all of the work involved in cleaning and tidying Study 2, through the development of a codebook. The other pieces of Study 2 are laid out in detail in the Study 2 Demonstration project, which we'll discuss today, and which we'll essentially replicate in new data after Thanksgiving. Homework 8 also covers a lot of the same material we expect to see in Study 2.

### How I Evaluate Your Presentation

Each year, I build a Google Form to help me evaluate your project presentations. The draft version of this yearâ€™s form is available to you at http://bit.ly/431-2018-draft-project-eval-form. There is no form for evaluating the actual portfolios.

- The only feedback you will get from me on your project will be what I say to you in the room. Your overall project grade (which is on a 100-point scale) is then part of your course grade. 
- To be fair, most people know when they leave my office after their presentation whether it went well or poorly. Most people emerge  calmer post-presentation than when they arrive.

### Study 1

- The Study 1 Demonstration project HTML can now be viewed at http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/study1-demo-431-2018.

As a reminder, the remaining steps I would take (were I you) for Project Study 1 are:

1. Make decisions about how you will revise each of your six Analyses. Follow Dr. Love's [suggestions and comments on your Survey Comparison Plan materials from Task D](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/plan-comments.md), and  be sure that where you've changed something, you look at the [section on Getting the Revisions Right](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/plan-comments.md#getting-the-revisions-right). 

2. Start with the [Study 1 Demonstration Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1), which I **updated** on 2018-11-12. 

- Get through Sections 1-5 of the [Study 1 Demonstration Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1) as soon as possible.
    - This includes (but is not limited to) the required merging and combination of all five data sets, [as discussed and demonstrated here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/surv2018_combining-datasets.md). Everyone needs to combine all five data sets to complete the project, although you will prune down the variables to your specific analytic data set at the end of section 2 (from the [Study 1 Demonstration Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1)), and then work only with those variables in sections 3-12.
    - This also includes the use of simple imputation, to deal with missingness (if it exists) in the variables you have selected for your analyses. [Imputation instructions and a demonstration are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/impute_example.md).
- Once you've done that, the analyses in Sections 6-12 should be more straightforward. The imputation is the only really new idea there. I encourage the use of the same `readthedown` formatting template I used in the demos in your Study 1 and Study 2.

3. Review the **updated** [Task G](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskG.html) and [Task H](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskH.html) instructions to be sure that you have completed all necessary analyses for Project Study 1, and that you have a clear understanding of the things you'll need to do in your presentation regarding Study 1. The main thing is to be sure you can move easily from Analysis to Analysis during the presentation.

After today's class, we'll have demonstrated all necessary Analyses you'll use in Study 1.

### Study 2

As of 2018-11-12, the [Project Study 2 Demonstration page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/demo_study2/README.md) is now complete. Get the R Markdown, data and HTML files for this demo at http://bit.ly/431-2018-demo-study2.

- To make it easier to discuss in class today, the Study 2 Demonstration HTML file is at http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/study2-demo-431-2018.
 
## A Primer on Mapping Data

At some point in today's discussion, it will be useful for me to show you a map of Ohio, with Delaware County identified. I figured out two ways to obtain this plot quickly (this is new for me) so I thought I would pass them along. 

- The [R Markdown file is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class22/mapping_primer.Rmd), but the HTML result shows up best [at this RPubs link](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/class22-431-2018-mapping).

## Visualization of the Day

"[How You Will Die](https://flowingdata.com/2016/01/19/how-you-will-die/)" from Nathan Yau at [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/)

## One Last Thing

Wyatt Bensken was good enough to point me to an interesting research letter at *JAMA Oncology* from 2018-10-18 by Kevin T Nead, Mackenzie R Wehner and Nandita Mitra entited "[The use of "trend" statements to describe statistically nonsignificant results in the oncology literature](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2705969). As he notes:

> They evaluated original research articles in four oncology journals and found that "8.7%  of original research articles used at least 1 trend statement to describe statistically nonsignificant results."

A disturbing trend.
