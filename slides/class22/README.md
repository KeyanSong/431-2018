## Project Updates

### Study 1

As we mentioned last week, [this is the place to go](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/survey-results) for...

1. Dr. Love's comments on your Survey Comparison Plan materials (from Task D). Remember that you **do not** submit revisions.
2. The data files you will need to actually do Project Study 1.
3. Materials to help you merge and combine data sets for the Project (particularly in Study 1), and to help you perform simple imputation using the `simputation` package in R, for any missing data that appears in your Project.

Don't forget about the Project Study 1 Demonstration page. You should be familiar with Analyses 1, 4, 5 and 6 before today's class, and we'll cover Analysis 2 in today's class, and Analysis 3 in Thursday's Class 22.

### Study 2

The Project Study 2 Demonstration page will be available in time for our discussion in Class 22 (Thursday 2018-11-15).

- Don't forget that [Task F](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskF.html) (Sharing Study 2 Data), is due at noon on Wednesday 2018-11-28, after the Thanksgiving break.
