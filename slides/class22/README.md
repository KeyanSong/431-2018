## Project Updates

### Study 1

- To make it easier to see, the Study 1 Demonstration project HTML file is also at http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/study1-demo-431-2018.

As a reminder, the remaining steps I would take (were I you) for Project Study 1 are:

1. Make decisions about how you will revise each of your six Analyses. Follow Dr. Love's [suggestions and comments on your Survey Comparison Plan materials from Task D](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/plan-comments.md), and  be sure that where you've changed something, you look at the [section on Getting the Revisions Right](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/plan-comments.md#getting-the-revisions-right). 

2. Start with the [Study 1 Demonstration Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1), which I **updated** on 2018-11-12. 

- Get through Sections 1-5 of the [Study 1 Demonstration Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1) as soon as possible.
    - This includes (but is not limited to) the required merging and combination of all five data sets, [as discussed and demonstrated here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/surv2018_combining-datasets.md). Everyone needs to combine all five data sets to complete the project, although you will prune down the variables to your specific analytic data set at the end of section 2 (from the [Study 1 Demonstration Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1)), and then work only with those variables in sections 3-12.
    - This also includes the use of simple imputation, to deal with missingness (if it exists) in the variables you have selected for your analyses. [Imputation instructions and a demonstration are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/survey-results/impute_example.md).
- Once you've done that, the analyses in Sections 6-12 should be more straightforward. The imputation is the only really new idea there. I encourage the use of the same `readthedown` formatting template I used in the demos in your Study 1 and Study 2.

3. Review the **updated** [Task G](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskG.html) and [Task H](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskH.html) instructions to be sure that you have completed all necessary analyses for Project Study 1, and that you have a clear understanding of the things you'll need to do in your presentation regarding Study 1. The main thing is to be sure you can move easily from Analysis to Analysis during the presentation.

After today's class, we'll have demonstrated all necessary Analyses you'll use in Study 1.

### Study 2

As of 2018-11-12, the [Project Study 2 Demonstration page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/demo_study2/README.md) is now complete. Get the R Markdown, data and HTML files for this demo at http://bit.ly/431-2018-demo-study2.

- To make it easier to discuss in class today, the Study 2 Demonstration HTML file is at http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/study2-demo-431-2018.
 
### The Main Hint for the Project

Get the little details and the big details right. This will be my final impression of you from 431, so put forward your best effort.

- Change the name of the project and author to match what **you** are doing. 
- Don't use my words (other than the headings) from the demonstration project to present your work. 
- Don't repeat my instructions or suggestions about how to do things. 
- Make careful decisions while coding and writing in R Markdown, and then review the HTML results to be sure they look clear and attractive. 

## A Primer on Mapping Data

At some point in today's discussion, it will be useful for me to show you a map of Ohio, with Delaware County identified. I figured out two ways to obtain this plot quickly (this is new for me) so I thought I would pass them along. 

- The [R Markdown file is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class22/mapping_primer.Rmd), but the HTML result shows up best [at this RPubs link](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/class22-431-2018-mapping).

## Visualization of the Day

"[How You Will Die](https://flowingdata.com/2016/01/19/how-you-will-die/)" from Nathan Yau at [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/)

## One Last Thing

Wyatt Bensken was good enough to point me to an interesting research letter at *JAMA Oncology* from 2018-10-18 by Kevin T Nead, Mackenzie R Wehner and Nandita Mitra entited "[The use of "trend" statements to describe statistically nonsignificant results in the oncology literature](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2705969). As he notes:

> They evaluated original research articles in four oncology journals and found that "8.7%  of original research articles used at least 1 trend statement to describe statistically nonsignificant results."

A disturbing trend.
