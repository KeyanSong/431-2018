## Project Updates

This was a [busy weekend](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/survey-results).

1. Dr. Love has now reviewed and commented on your Survey Comparison Plan materials (from Task D). 
2. Dr. Love has also prepared the data files you will need to actually do Project Study 1.
3. He has also prepared materials to help you merge and combine data sets for the Project.
4. He has also prepared materials to help you do simple imputation for any missing data in the Project.

See the details on all four of these things at [this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/survey-results).

## Election Day

- We'll check in again on the Ohio [Governor's Race forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/governor/) at FiveThirtyEight, and [anything new they've added recently](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). 
- We might also glance at the [Latest Polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/) as compiled by FiveThirtyEight.
- Another thing to consider is the [CBS News / YouGov House Model](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/11/04/cbs-newsyougov-house-model-democrats-225-republica) which uses multilevel regression and post-stratification (Mr. P for short), which is a technique that a lot of statisticians are excited about.

## One Last Thing

Rafael Irizarry wrote a provocative blog post on 2018-11-01 called ["The role of academia in data science education"](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/11/01/the-role-of-academia-in-data-science-education/) which I found interesting. I would very much enjoy finding the time to ponder this sort of thing more deeply.
