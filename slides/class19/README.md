## Project Updates

This was a [busy weekend](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/survey-results).

1. Dr. Love has now reviewed and commented on your Survey Comparison Plan materials (from Task D). 
2. Dr. Love has also prepared the data files you will need to actually do Project Study 1.
3. He has also prepared materials to help you merge and combine data sets for the Project.
4. He has also prepared materials to help you do simple imputation for any missing data in the Project.

See the details on all four of these things at [this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/survey-results).

## RYouWithMe, A New Resource from R-Ladies Sydney

[RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/ryouwithme) is a new series of online learning resources for using R, oriented towards R beginners and providing a solid foundation of R skills. Their [first "unit" - called Basic Basics](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics/) is now available! It contains three lessons:

1. [An opinionated tour of RStudio](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics-1/)
2. [Installing and loading packages](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics-2/)
3. [Getting data into RStudio](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics-3/)

There are plans to roll out four additional units, on data wrangling, visualization, the R language, and R Markdown, by the end of the year. If you find these helpful, let us know!

## Election Day

There's a lot of exciting stuff to read...

### At FiveThirtyEight, I particularly enjoyed...

- Nate Silver's ["Democrats Aren't Certain to Take the House, but They're Pretty Clear Favorites"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/final-election-update-democrats-arent-certain-to-take-the-house-but-theyre-pretty-clear-favorites/)
- Nathaniel Rakich's ["How To Watch the Midterms: An Hour-By-Hour Guide"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2018-election-polls-close/) 
- FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast had several interesting episodes. I recommend:
  - ["The Midterms Are Here"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-the-midterms-are-here) from 2018-11-05.
  - ["Model Talk: How To Judge Our Forecasts](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-how-to-judge-our-forecasts/) from 2018-11-02.
- We'll check in again on the Ohio [Governor's Race and other Midterm Election forecasts](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/governor/) at FiveThirtyEight.
- We might also glance at the [Latest Polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/) at FiveThirtyEight, too.

### Some Other Sites...

- The [CBS News / YouGov House Model](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/11/04/cbs-newsyougov-house-model-democrats-225-republica) which uses multilevel regression and post-stratification (Mr. P for short), which is a technique that a lot of statisticians are excited about. 
- [CNN provides its own Forecast](https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/forecast), too, built by a team of data scientists led by Harry Enten (formerly of FiveThirtyEight). There are [some descriptions of their methodology](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/politics/the-forecast-methodology/index.html), and some interesting graphics.
- This evening, you may want to visit [The Needle](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/upshot/needle-election-night-2018-midterms.html) and related live election forecasts at [The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot), from *The New York Times*.
- The Washington Post is providing timely [Midterm Election Updates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live-updates/midterms/midterm-election-updates), too. 
  - You might be interested in Jordan Heller's ["Ohio ballot initiative on drug penalties is motivating voters in Cleveland"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live-updates/midterms/midterm-election-updates/ohio-ballot-initiative-on-drug-penalties-is-motivating-voters-in-cleveland/?utm_term=.9c3a2631e8d7) piece from last night, for example.
- If you like Fox News, they have [midterm power rankings](https://www.foxnews.com/midterms-2018) which rate elections in a more traditional way. I'm not sure whether a model is driving this, or not.

## One Last Thing

Rafael Irizarry wrote a provocative blog post on 2018-11-01 called ["The role of academia in data science education"](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/11/01/the-role-of-academia-in-data-science-education/) which I found interesting. I would very much enjoy finding the time to ponder this sort of thing more deeply.
