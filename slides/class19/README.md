## Visualization of the Day (non-Election edition)

For those of you in need of a pick-me-up, Nathan Yau offers ["Years You Have Left to Live, Probably"](https://flowingdata.com/2015/09/23/years-you-have-left-to-live-probably/) which presents simulation results based on data from the U.S. Social Security Administration.

## Election Day

- We might also glance at the [Latest Polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/) as compiled by FiveThirtyEight.

## One Last Thing

Rafael Irizarry wrote a provocative blog post on 2018-11-01 called ["The role of academia in data science education"](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/11/01/the-role-of-academia-in-data-science-education/) which I found interesting. I would very much enjoy finding the time to ponder this sort of thing more deeply.
