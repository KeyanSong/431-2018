## Project Updates

### Study 1

As we mentioned last week, [this is the place to go](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/survey-results) for...

1. Dr. Love's comments on your Survey Comparison Plan materials (from Task D). 
2. The data files you will need to actually do Project Study 1.
3. Materials to help you merge and combine data sets for the Project (particularly in Study 1), and to help you perform simple imputation using the `simputation` package in R, for any missing data that appears in your Project.

Don't forget about the Project Study 1 Demonstration page.
