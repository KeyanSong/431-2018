## Project Updates

### Study 1

As we mentioned last week, [this is the place to go](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/survey-results) for...

1. Dr. Love's comments on your Survey Comparison Plan materials (from Task D). Remember that you **do not** submit revisions.
2. The data files you will need to actually do Project Study 1.
3. Materials to help you merge and combine data sets for the Project (particularly in Study 1), and to help you perform simple imputation using the `simputation` package in R, for any missing data that appears in your Project.

Don't forget about the [Project Study 1 Demonstration page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1).

- You should be familiar with Analyses 1, 4, 5 and 6 before today's class, and we'll cover Analysis 2 in today's class, and Analysis 3 in Thursday's Class 22.
- **Naming Things** is hard. But don't make it harder on yourself by picking a very generic name (like `survey` for the data you will use. Even `sur431` is better than that, since `survey` is an important package name in R.
- Use the template I used in the Project Study 1 Demonstration document, if at all possible.

### Study 2

1. Today we'll discuss the projects by people whose family names start with S-Z in the [Approved Project Proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/OKtaskA.md#s-v).

2. The Project Study 2 Demonstration page will be available in time for our discussion in Class 22 (Thursday 2018-11-15).

3. Don't forget that [Task F](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/taskF.html) (Sharing Study 2 Data), is due at noon on Wednesday 2018-11-28, after the Thanksgiving break.

## One Last Thing: RYouWithMe, A New Resource from R-Ladies Sydney

[RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/ryouwithme) is a new series of online learning resources for using R, oriented towards R beginners and providing a solid foundation of R skills. Their [first "unit" - called Basic Basics](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics/) is now available! It contains three lessons:

1. [An opinionated tour of RStudio](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics-1/)
2. [Installing and loading packages](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics-2/)
3. [Getting data into RStudio](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/11/05/basicbasics-3/)

There are plans to roll out four additional units, on data wrangling, visualization, the R language, and R Markdown, by the end of the year. If you find these helpful, let us know!
