## Repeating the Announcements sent via email last Friday 2018-10-26...

1. I have completed building the codebook / data description document for the project survey. It is a Google Sheet that I have posted at http://bit.ly/431-2018-survey-data-codebook. Log into Google via CWRU to see it. 
    - The Sheet lists every item and every scale I will provide to you for analyses, and specifies the item numbers (and names) you will need to complete Project Task D.
    - You will need that codebook in order to successfully complete the Project Task D (Survey Comparison Plan) form, which you'll find at http://bit.ly/431-2018-survey-comparison-plan-taskD. 
    - Those of you who responded to that form before 2018-10-27 will need to revise your work in light of the many small changes I made to item numbers in building the new codebook. I am very sorry for this inconvenience. The good news is that only a few items have had a meaningful change in their location in the survey, but you'll need to check your work and make all necessary adjustments before the deadline for Task D. 
    - The Project Task D deadline is Friday 2018-11-02 at noon.

2. [Here is the actual survey](http://bit.ly/431-2018-survey) that you will take to satisfy Project Task E. Remember that completing the survey is due at the same time as Task D: noon on Friday 2018-11-02. 
    - I think there are 156 items. Scroll to the end of the survey and answer the final question (your name) and then submit if you want to stop work partway through but return later where you stopped.

3. My summaries of all 49 project proposals [are now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/OKtaskA.md). Please take a look.

4. Homework:

- The Homework 5 answer sketch [is now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework5). Grades and a rubric will likely be available on Thursday 2018-11-01.
- Homework 6 [is available now](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework6/431-2018-hw6.md). That assignment is due 2018-11-09 at noon. 
- Homework 7 [is also now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework7/431-2018-hw7.md) and is due 2018-11-16 at noon.

5. Canvas and the various Google Forms should now be up to date in terms of deadlines for remaining Project Tasks and Homeworks. Remember that the Course Calendar page at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/calendar.md is the final word on everything.

6. The audio files for Class 16 are now posted to the [Class 16 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/slides/class16) page.
