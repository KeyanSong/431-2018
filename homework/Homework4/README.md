# 431 Homework 4 Main Page

Homework 4 is due at noon on Friday 2018-09-28. It contains seven questions.

- Homework 4 [instructions are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework4/431-2018-hw4.md).

Any assignment received more than 60 minutes after the deadline is considered late. **Don't be late.**

## Steps to a Successful Homework

Here are the steps I would take to do the homework, after I read [the instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework4/431-2018-hw4.md), and after I'd read Chapters 2 and 3 of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise*.

1. Create a new directory called something like `431HW4`, specifically for this homework assignment.
2. Open R Studio, and create a new R Project in this existing `431HW4` directory. 
3. Either create a new R Markdown file from scratch, or use one of the provided templates for an earlier assignment or for general work. Edit in R Studio to get what you want, and then be sure to save it using your actual name in the file name.
4. Knit the file in R Studio to create an HTML file, which should have your actual name in it, not something like `YOURNAME-hw4.html`
5. Review the HTML file closely, and make changes to the R Markdown file and re-knit until you are satisfied.
6. Write the response to the essay question as part of your R Markdown file. Leave blank lines between paragraphs to help us read your work. 
7. Submit your final R Markdown file and your final HTML file to us via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), by the deadline, which again is noon Friday 2018-09-28.

## General Tips on Homework Submission

1. Submit HTML and R Markdown, without zipping the files together.
2. Use complete sentences, and proper English grammar, syntax and spelling. To use R Studio's spell-checker, hit F7.
3. Avoid printing things we don't need to see (like data frames) to judge your work.
4. Place empty lines before and after each code chunk.
5. Name every chunk, with no characters other than letters, numbers and underscores. No repetition!
6. Use headings to indicate the question being solved. Then leave a blank line before continuing with text.
7. Avoid repeating Dr. Love's questions verbatim.
8. When available, use a template, and don't fight it.
